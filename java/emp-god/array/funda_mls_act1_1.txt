Given an array of integer [0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 22, 50, 51, 60, 200, 100, 1001, 2003, 54023, 237493, 10000, 23400, 284750]. Check if the length of the array is even or odd, if it is even then add all even elements of the array to a new array with variable name evenElements otherwise if the length of the array is odd then add the significant value of each element in the array with variable name signicantValueElements e.g. 50 -> 1, 2003 -> 4, 10000 -> 1 (significant value is the count of numbers before trailing N zero number).

example: array = [10, 20, 30, 33, 1001, 200]
	 length = 6
	 evenElements = [10, 20, 30, 200]
	 significantValueElements = []

	 array = [10, 20, 30, 33, 1001, 200, 201]
	 length = 7
	 evenElements = []
	 significantValueElements = [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3]

Regardless which array is created (evenElements or significantValueElement), check if the array is a palindrome - a palindrome is sequence that reads the same backwards as forward e.g. [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1] -> [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1]. If the array is a palindrome then count the occurrence of each element of the array e.g. [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1] -> 1 = 6, 4 = 1 and put it in a multidimensional array with the outer matrix holding the value of the element and the inner matrix holding the value of the occurrence of the specific element, make sure that in index 0 the number stored is the element itself while in index 1 is the count of occurrence e.g. [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1] -> array[][] = [[1,6],[4,1]] where 1 and 6 or 4 and 1 is the element and count of occurrence in the original array respectively. After putting the desired values in the multidimensional array, display it in the order below:

Element 1 occurred 6 times..
Element 4 occurred once..
Element 6 occurred twice..
Element 10 occurred 3 times..
END

If the array is not palindrome, display the roman numeral of each element of the array e.g. [1, 10, 100] -> I, X, C with the format below:

given: [1, 10, 100] -> I, X, C

Element 1 is I..
Element 10 is X..
Element 100 is C..
END
