1. Display "ROCK STRENGTH CALCULATOR" and the name and stubcode.
2. Display options for the type of rock strength to calculate: compressive, tensile, or shear.
3. Prompt the user to enter a letter corresponding to the type of rock strength they want to calculate.
4. If the user entered "C" or "c":
    a. Display instructions for calculating compressive strength.
    b. Prompt the user to enter the value of P.
    c. Prompt the user to enter the value of A.
    d. Calculate the compressive strength by dividing P by A.
    e. Display the calculated compressive strength.
5. If the user entered "T" or "t":
    a. Display instructions for calculating tensile strength.
    b. Prompt the user to enter the value of P.
    c. Prompt the user to enter the value of t.
    d. Prompt the user to enter the value of D.
    e. Calculate the tensile strength by using this formula -> tensile =(2*p)/(3.1416 * d * t)
    f. Display the calculated tensile strength.
6. If the user entered "S" or "s":
    a. Display instructions for calculating shear strength.
    b. Prompt the user to enter the value of Z.
    c. Prompt the user to enter the value of t.
    d. Prompt the user to enter the value of C.
    e. Calculate the shear strength by using this formula -> shear = z + i * tan(f)
    f. Display the calculated shear strength.
7. Prompt the user to enter a key to calculate rock strength again or "n" to exit.
8. If the user entered a key other than "n", go back to step 3.
9. If the user entered "n", display a farewell message and exit the program.
