1. Start the program
2. Initialize variables needed (choice, mass, deltaT, heatCapacity, specificHeatCapacity)
3. Print the available choices and ask the user to press any key corresponding on the choice
4. Switch case
	- if choice is 1, get the user inputs needed to compute heat capacity. Compute and print.Ask the user if he/she wants to continue. If not end the program, else go back to number 3
	- if choice is 2, get the user inputs needed to compute specific heat capacity. Compute and print. Ask the user if he/she wants to continue. If not end the program, else go back to number 3
	- if choice is 3, get the user inputs needed to compute mass. Compute and print. Ask the user if he/she wants to continue. If not end the program, else go back to number 3
	- if choice is 4, get the user inputs needed to compute change in temperature. Compute and print. Ask the user if he/she wants to continue. If not end the program, else go back to number 3
	- if choice is 5, end the program
5. End the program
