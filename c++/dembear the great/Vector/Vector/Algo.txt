1. Set up the necessary libraries and variables, including font information, a handle to the console, and various constants such as the length of the loading bar and the time it takes to load.
2. Define a helper function called "center_indent" that takes in the length of a string and returns the necessary indentation to center the string on the console.
3. Print the title art for the program, using the "unroll_print" function to animate the printing.
4. Print a loading bar, using the "loading_bar" function to animate the progress.
5. Enter an infinite loop to allow for continuous calculations.
6. Clear the console.
7. Reprint the title art and reset the center indentation.
8. Prompt the user to input the values of X and Y for a vector and read in the values.
9. Calculate the magnitude and angle of the vector using the formulas:
	- magnitude = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
	- angle = atan2(y, x)
10. Print the results to the console, using the "center_indent" function to center the output.
11. Prompt the user to press enter to continue or any other key to exit the program.
12. If the user presses enter, return to the beginning of the loop. If they press any other key, exit the program.
